These are some things that still need working on.

Paste only works once

No font formatting options, new button doesn’t work. No function option when clicked in UI (Insert->Function), the button does nothing. Same for Help->About ExcelClone

Graph UI doesn’t work unless the cells are selected first, pie option crashes program when no cells selected

Circular referencing works, but referencing a circular reference crashes the program. (stack problem; error in parser.cs)

Save/Load doesn’t save row and column sizes.
